<b> Django </b>       
No need to worry about Database.   
Written in Python, comparing to other programming languages, simple.  
Simple and easy-use Administration interface.   
Open source, we can have abundant help.   
Great security, it hides our source code.      

Compare with Flask   
Advantages of Django are below:    
Django provides an all-inclusive experience: you get an admin panel, database interfaces, an ORM, and directory structure for your apps and projects out of the box.    
Django has a conventional project structure is used in django while in flask an an arbitrary structure is used. This structure your application according to best practices while saving a lot of time in development hours.    
Django uses specific names for, url files(Urls.py), model files(models.py) and views files(views.py) which simplifies the adding of new people into the project, as they immediately understand where everything is and codebase navigation is easy for them.    
Django was created for fast development of complex web apps. Fully featured right out of the box, developers have all the tools they need to implement and develop easily scalable, reliable, and maintainable web apps, in record time. Flask’s simplicity allows experienced developers to create smaller apps in short timeframes, this won’t be the case for large apps.    
Django has a huge active developer community. This means that if you need help with blockers, or finding django developers to start contributing when it’s time to scale your app. There is also a wealth of useful content already in the public domain. The Flask community is currently not as big, and so information may be harder to come by.    
Flask is more suited to smaller, less complicated applications, while Django is designed for larger, more complex, and high-load applications.   
Unlike Flask, Django comes with a built-in bootstrapping tool — django-admin which enables developers to start building web applications without any external input.
