# Product Definition     
## Product Mission   
“Let students make friends while choosing courses easier”    
Explain:     
Firstly, based on the prerequisites and academic interests, our system can recommend potential students who have similar background and academic expectations, by which they are able to match automatically and have a chance to form a group in the same courses.Then we make a recommendation of the courses they might be interested in according to their former performances, such as the courses they have learned and researches they have done before.

Target User(s)   
BU students with similar interests and prerequisites on the same academic area, especially students who are in the same department or majors.

As a student user who is looking for professional advice, I would like to get some course recommendations based on my choices (interests, pre-courses I have taken), so that I can choose course wisly following their advice.
